# Travel-dash
Using fetch APIs, this app creates a homing station for your travels and adventures. With booking from the fictional, "Let's Go!" Travel agencey, your next trip is just a few clicks away. See where you've been in the past. View your upcoming trips. Even see how much money you spent traveling last year.

## Project Goals 
* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with an API to send and receive data
* Solidify the code review process
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Project Context
This solo project was completed over 6 days while a student at the Turing School of Software & Desgin.

## Technologies
* Fetch API to retrieve and add data
* Mocha and Chai for testing code (TDD implemented)
* Javascript
* HTML, CSSS
* For testing accessibility: Lighthouse, Wave, and screen-reader.

## Setup
1. You'll want to fork and clone down this repo to your terminal.
2. Inside your terminal: cd into the file.
3. Type in npm install.
4. Type in npm start.
5. Cut and paste: http://localhost:8080/ in a separate tab in your browser. (You won't see anything until you set up the local server).
6. In a separte terminal tab or window you will set up the local server to run in the background, by doing this:  
7. Clone the local server from travel-tracker-api (Find it here: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api
8. cd into the file.
9. Run npm install and then npm start
10. Server will be located at http://localhost:3001. It will run in the background. 
  
## Wins, Challenges overcome, Next steps
After only a few months of learning to code, this was the largest project I have built to date. 
Using fetch to get and post data from apis was a win.
Anticipating sad paths a user could take and trying to account for all possible errors was a challenge. 
I began the project using materializecss, but removed it when I could not adapt it to meet the accessibility markers required. 
While that left a simple design in it's place, the power behind the page to effectively take in and manipulate data remained.
It would be fun to write more css in the futre to present a modern and professional site design.
