# Travel-dash
Using fetch APIs, this app creates a homing station for your travels and adventures. With booking from the fictional, "Let's Go!" Travel agencey, your next trip is just a few clicks away. See where you've been in the past. View your upcoming trips. Even see how much money you spent traveling last year.

## Project Goals 
* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with an API to send and receive data
* Solidify the code review process
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Project Context
This solo project was completed over 6 days while a student at the Turing School of Software & Desgin.

## Technologies
* Fetch API to retrieve and add data
* Mocha and Chai for testing code (TDD implemented)
* Javascript
* HTML, CSSS
* For testing accessibility: Lighthouse, Wave, and screen-reader.

## Setup
1. You'll want to fork and clone down this repo to your terminal.
2. Inside your terminal: cd into the file.
3. Type in npm install.
4. Type in npm start.
5. Cut and paste: http://localhost:8080/ in a separate tab in your browser. (You won't see anything until you set up the local server).
6. In a separte terminal tab or window you will set up the local server to run in the background, by doing this:  
7. Clone the local server from travel-tracker-api (Find it here: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api
8. cd into the file.
9. Run npm install and then npm start
10. Server will be located at http://localhost:3001. It will run in the background. 
  
## Wins, Challenges overcome, Next steps
 * After only a few months of learning to code, this was the largest project I have built to date. 
 * Using fetch to get and post data from apis was a win.
 * Anticipating sad paths a user could take and trying to account for all possible errors was a challenge. 
 * I began the project using materializecss, but removed it when I could not adapt it to meet the accessibility markers required. While that left a simple design in it's place, the power behind the page to effectively take in and manipulate data remained.
 * It would be fun to write more css in the futre to present a modern and professional site design.
